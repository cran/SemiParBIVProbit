\title{SemiParBIVProbit summary}

\description{
It takes a fitted \code{SemiParBIVProbit} object produced by \code{SemiParBIVProbit()} and produces some summaries from it.

\usage{

\method{summary}{SemiParBIVProbit}(object, n.sim = 100, prob.lev = 0.05, cm.plot = FALSE, 
        xlim = c(-3, 3), ylim = c(-3, 3),

\arguments{ 

\item{object}{A fitted \code{SemiParBIVProbit} object as produced by \code{SemiParBIVProbit()}.}

\item{x}{\code{summary.SemiParBIVProbit} object produced by \code{summary.SemiParBIVProbit()}.}

\item{n.sim}{The number of simulated coefficient vectors from the posterior distribution of the estimated model parameters. This is used 
to calculate intervals for the association parameter, dispersion coefficient and other measures (e.g., gamma measure). It may be increased if
            more precision is required.} 

\item{prob.lev}{Probability of the left and right tails of the posterior distribution used for interval calculations.} 
                    
\item{cm.plot}{If \code{TRUE} then a filled bivariate contour meta plot corresponding to the assumed (estimated) bivariate model is produced.}   
             
\item{xlim, ylim}{Limits of the bivariate contour meta plot.}    

\item{ylab, xlab}{Labels for the bivariate contour meta plot.} 

\item{gm}{If \code{TRUE} then intervals for the gamma measure and odds ratio are calculated.} 
                     
\item{n.grid}{Number of grid points used in contour plot construction. This is relevant for continuous margins.} 

\item{n.dig}{Number of digit points used in rounding bivariate pdf values for contour plot construction. This is relevant for continuous margins.} 

\item{digits}{Number of digits printed in output.} 

\item{signif.stars}{By default significance stars are printed alongside output.} 
                         
\item{...}{Other graphics parameters to pass on to plotting commands. These are used only when \code{cm.plot=TRUE}.}

\details{ 

Using some low level functions in \code{mgcv}, based on the results of Marra and Wood (2012), `Bayesian p-values' are returned for the 
smooth terms. These have better frequentist performance than their frequentist counterpart. See the help file of 
\code{summary.gam} in \code{mgcv} for further details. Covariate selection can also be achieved 
using a single penalty shrinkage approach as shown in Marra and Wood (2011). 

Posterior simulation is used to obtain intervals of nonlinear functions of parameters, such as the association and dispersion parameters
as well as the odds ratio and gamma measure discussed by Tajar et al. (2001) if \code{gm = TRUE}. 

The bivariate contour meta plot has been introduced to provide the user with a pictorial representation of the
latent distribution of the model errors.  

\code{print.summary.SemiParBIVProbit} prints model term summaries.

\item{tableP1}{Table containing parametric estimates, their standard errors, z-values and p-values for equation 1.}
\item{tableP2,tableP3, ...}{As above but for equation 2 and equations 3 and 4 if present.}
\item{tableNP1}{Table of nonparametric summaries for each smooth component including effective degrees of freedom, estimated rank, 
                approximate Wald statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the smooth term is zero and 
                corresponding p-value, for equation 1.}
\item{tableNP2,tableNP3, ...}{As above but for equation 2 and equations 3 and 4 if present.}
\item{n}{Sample size.}
\item{theta}{Estimated dependence parameter linking the two equations.}
\item{formula1,formula2,formula3, ...}{Formulas used for the model equations.}
\item{l.sp1,l.sp2,l.sp3, ...}{Number of smooth components in model equations.}
\item{t.edf}{Total degrees of freedom of the estimated bivariate model.}
\item{CItheta}{Interval(s) for \eqn{\theta}{\theta}.}
\item{n.sel}{Number of selected observations in the sample selection case.}
\item{OR, CIor}{Odds ratio and related CI. The odds ratio is a measure of association between binary random variables and is defined as 
                p00p11/p10p01. In the case of independence this ratio is equal to 1. It can take values in the range (-Inf, Inf) and 
                it does not depend on the marginal probabilities (Tajar et al., 2001). Interval is calculated using posterior simulation.}
\item{GM, CIgm}{Gamma measure and related CI. This measure of association was proposed by Goodman and Kruskal (1954). It is defined as 
                (\code{OR} - 1)/(\code{OR} + 1), can take values in the range (-1, 1) and does not depend on the marginal probabilities.
                Interval is calculated using posterior simulation.}
\item{tau, CIkt}{Kendall's tau and respective intervals.}
