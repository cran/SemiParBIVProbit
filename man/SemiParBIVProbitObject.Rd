\item{fit}{List of values and diagnostics extracted from the output of the algorithm. For instance, \code{fit$gradient}, \code{fit$Fisher} and \code{fit$S.h} return
           the gradient vector, Fisher information (when used) and overall penalty matrix scaled 
           by its smoothing parameters, for the fitted bivariate probit model. See the 
           documentation of \code{trust} for details on the diagnostics provided.}

\item{gam1}{Univariate fit for equation 1. See the documentation of \code{mgcv} for full details.}

\item{gam2, gam3, ...}{Univariate fit for equation 2 and equations 3 and 4 (these are available when the dispersion and association parameters

                    coefficients for the second equation, and dispersion parameter (or coefficients for the third equation) and

\item{HeSh}{Unpenalized -hessian/Fisher.}

          used for confidence/credible interval calculations.}
 
\item{F}{This is obtained multiplying Vb by HeSh.} 
 
\item{t.edf}{Total degrees of freedom of the estimated bivariate model. It is calculated as \code{sum(diag(F))}.}

\item{edf1, edf2, edf3, ...}{Degrees of freedom for the two equations of the fitted bivariate model (and for the third and fourth
                        equations if present. They  
                        are calculated when splines are used.}
