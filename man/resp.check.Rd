\title{Plots for response variable}

\description{ 

It produces a histogram of the response along with the estimated density from the assumed distribution as well as a normal Q-Q plot for 
the (randomised) normalised quantile response. It also provides the log-likelihood for AIC calculation, for instance.

\details{

Prior to fitting a model with discrete and/or continuous margins, the distributions for the responses
may be chosen by looking at the histogram of the response along with the estimated density from the assumed distribution, and at the
normalised quantile responses. These will provide a rough guide to the adequacy of the chosen distribution.
The latter are defined as the quantile standard normal function of the cumulative distribution function of the response with scale and location
estimated by MLE. These should behave approximately as normally distributed variables (even though the original 
observations are not). Therefore, a normal Q-Q plot is appropriate here. 

If \code{loglik = TRUE} then this function also provides the log-likelihood for AIC calculation, for instance.

The shapiro test can also be performed.
